# Getting Started

Just add it to Cargo.toml ğŸ˜„

For WASM or single-threaded environments you'll need to turn off default features and remember to add other features back in, like this:

```toml
shipyard = { features = ["proc", "serialization"], default-features = false, git = "https://github.com/leudz/shipyard.git" }
```
