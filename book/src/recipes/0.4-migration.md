0.4 comes with a few big changes, this chapter aims to facilitate the transition.

## Imports

Let's start small, prelude and internal no longer exist, you just have to replace all `shipyard::prelude` and `shipyard::internal` by `shipyard`.

## Systems

Following [an issue](https://github.com/leudz/shipyard/issues/75) opened by [@cart](https://github.com/cart), systems will become functions instead of an instance of the `System` trait.  

To make this work, borrowing is now done with the actual types you get when you borrow a storage instead of using references.  

In 0.3:
```rust, noplaypen
struct MySystem;
impl<'sys> System<'sys> for MySystem {
    type Data = (
        EntitiesMut,
        &mut usize,
    );
    fn run((mut entities, mut usizes): <Self::Data as SystemData<'sys>>::View) {}
}

// or with the macro

#[system(MySystem)]
fn run(mut entities: &mut Entities, mut usizes: &mut usize) {}
```
In 0.4:
```rust, noplaypen
fn my_system((mut entities, mut usizes): (EntitiesViewMut, ViewMut<usize>)) {}

// or with the macro

#[system_fn]
fn my_system(mut entities: EntitiesViewMut, mut usizes: ViewMut<usize>) {}
```

This change also affects `run` and `borrow`.  
`World::run_system` is no longer needed and you can run systems with `run` directly.

```rust, noplaypen
world.run(my_system);

// and closures still work

world.run(|(mut entities, mut usizes): (EntitiesViewMut, ViewMut<usize>)| {});
```

`run` has the same return type as the system or closure.

Here's the complete list:

0.3|0.4
:---:|:---:
`AllStorages` / `&mut AllStorages`|[`AllStoragesViewMut`](https://docs.rs/shipyard/latest/shipyard/struct.AllStoragesViewMut.html)
`Entities` / `&Entities`|[`EntitiesView`](https://docs.rs/shipyard/latest/shipyard/struct.EntitiesView.html)
`EntitiesMut` / `&mut Entities`|[`EntitiesViewMut`](https://docs.rs/shipyard/latest/shipyard/struct.EntitiesViewMut.html)
`&T`|[`View<T>`](https://docs.rs/shipyard/latest/shipyard/struct.View.html)
`&mut T`|[`ViewMut<T>`](https://docs.rs/shipyard/latest/shipyard/struct.ViewMut.html)
`ThreadPool` / `&ThreadPool`|[`ThreadPoolView`](https://docs.rs/shipyard/latest/shipyard/struct.ThreadPoolView.html)
`Unique<&T>`|[`UniqueView<T>`](https://docs.rs/shipyard/latest/shipyard/struct.UniqueView.html)
`Unique<&mut T>`|[`UniqueViewMut<T>`](https://docs.rs/shipyard/latest/shipyard/struct.UniqueViewMut.html)
`NonSend<&T>`|[`NonSend<View<T>>`](https://docs.rs/shipyard/latest/shipyard/struct.NonSend.html)
`NonSend<&mut T>`|[`NonSend<ViewMut<T>>`](https://docs.rs/shipyard/latest/shipyard/struct.NonSend.html)
`Unique<NonSend<&T>>`|[`NonSend<UniqueView<T>>`](https://docs.rs/shipyard/latest/shipyard/struct.NonSend.html)
`Unique<NonSend<&mut T>>`|[`NonSend<UniqueViewMut<T>>`](https://docs.rs/shipyard/latest/shipyard/struct.NonSend.html)
`FakeBorrow<T>`|[`FakeBorrow<T>`](https://docs.rs/shipyard/latest/shipyard/struct.FakeBorrow.html)

`NonSync` and `NonSendSync` follow the same pattern as `NonSend`.

## Macro

The macro is less useful now and becomes opt-in, you'll have to add the `proc` feature in order to use it:
```toml
shipyard = { version = "^0.4", features = ["proc"] }
```

## Workloads

### The ugly

Workloads are the only one suffering a downgrade. You'll have to give all systems twice to the function plus a few things.

In 0.3:
```rust, noplaypen
world.add_workload<(Sys1, Sys2), _>("Workload1");
```
In 0.4:
```rust, noplaypen
world
    .add_workload("Workload1")
    .with_system((
        |world: &World| world.try_run(sys1),
        sys1
    ))
    .with_system((
        |world: &World| world.try_run(sys2),
        sys2
    ))
    .build();

// with a macro

world
    .add_workload("Workload1")
    .with_system(system!(sys1))
    .with_system(system!(sys2))
    .build();
```

⚠️ The two arguments are wrapped in a tuple.

This repetition will disappear someday but I don't expect it to be soon.  
You don't have to use a closure, any function with `&World` as argument and returning `Result<(), shipyard::error::Run>` are valid.  
It's very important to pass the same function twice, the workload might always error if this isn't the case.

### The good

Workloads don't come with only a downgrade. You can now return errors from systems inside workloads.

```rust, noplaypen
struct TerribleError;

fn my_sys(mut entities: EntitiesViewMut) -> Result<(), TerribleError> {
    Err(TerribleError)
}

fn main() {
    use shipyard::error::Run;

    let world = World::new();
    world
        .add_workload("May fail")
        .with_system((
            |world: &World| {
                world
                    .try_run(my_sys)?
                    .map_err(Run::from_custom)
            },
            my_sys,
        ))
        .build();
    match world.run_default() {
        Run::Custom(error) => {
            let terrible_error = error.downcast::<TerribleError>();
        },
        _ => {}
    }
}
```

The error has to be anonymized so you'll get back a `Box<dyn Any + Send>`.  
Workloads stop at the first error encountered, just like 0.3.  
You can also use the `try_system!` macro the same way as `system!`.

```rust, noplaypen
world
    .add_workload("May fail")
    .with_system(try_system!(my_sys))
    .build();
```
It'll generate the same code as above.

## Iterator

You can now use `std::iter::Iterator` and `for loop` with views without having to call `into_iter`.  
All iteration code from 0.3 will still work.

```rust, noplaypen
fn my_sys((mut usizes, u32s): (ViewMut<usize>, View<u32>)) {
    for (i, &j) in (&mut usizes, &u32s).iter() {
        *i += j as usize;
    }
}
```
