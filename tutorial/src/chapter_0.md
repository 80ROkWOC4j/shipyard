# Introduction

This tutorial aims to teach how to use [shipyard](https://github.com/leudz/shipyard). It is based on [Herbert Wolverson](https://github.com/thebracket)'s [Roguelike Tutorial](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/).

This tutorial won't teach Rust. It is recommended to have read the [official book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) or a similar source of information before.
If you are already familiar with the ECS pattern, [the guide](https://leudz.github.io/shipyard/guide) might be a faster way to learn.
